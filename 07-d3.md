We've finally learned everything we need to know to start using D3. 
D3 is a Javascript library. This means that we can use all of the Javascript commands that we have already learned, but on top of these, there are a few new functions that will make our life easier.

The main purpose of D3 is to create visualisations of data online. Because it uses Javascript, it is possible to make graphs interactive! 

As a little refresher, we will repeat a little bit html to set up our page. 

Create `index.html` containing the following:

~~~{.html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>The Wealth & Health of the N-Nations</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>The Wealth & Health of the N-Nations</h1>

    <p id="chart"_area></p>

    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

There are a few things in this file that look new:
'<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />' is linking the local css file (that can just be an empty file for now). `<script src="main.js"></script>` is linking the Javascript file, the file in which all the action will happen. 

Additionally, we now need to link d3 using `<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>`. 

The last bit, that's important here is an html element (paragraph) we create. We give it an id `chart_area`. This is the area we reserve for our pretty chart. We will use Javascript (and D3) to fill it in. 


Now, let's write main.js.

Similar to the syntax we've already seen (`JSON.stringify`), D3-specific functions can be called using a `d3.`-syntax.

The first thing we need, is of course our data, which is stored in 'nations.json'.
D3 provides a handy function to read in `json`-files:

~~~{.d3}
d3.json("resources/nations.json", function(nations) { }
~~~

This line probably needs a little explanation and we'll go through it bit by bit: 

* `d3.json()` is called the function call. In this case, we have a function that reads in a json file, parses it, and is also able to do something with the parsed data on the way.
* The first argument `"resources/nations.json"` tells the function where to get the data we want to have parsed.
* `function(...){...}` is called the callback function. It is a so-called 'inline' function, which means it has no name (we're only operating in the object space here). This also means we can't use this function anywhere else in our code. The code we put inside the curly brackets is the code that's run once d3.json() is called and the data is loaded.
* D3 assigns the name `nations` to the parsed object it returns. We can only use 'nations' within the callback function, this means our code only knows of `nations` inside the curly brackets.
* What seems unusual, but is actually quite common, is that this function call doesn't return anything. It is simply executed and displayed (if we tell it to), but no value is returned. 


So naturally, the next step is to think about what we want to happen between the curly brackets.
For now, we want to:

* Link Javascript to html page
* Insert an svg canvas
* Create axes (x: income per capita, y: life expectancy)
* Display data points (scatter plot)


We need to let the Javascript and the html file know where the action is happening. 
To do this, we use the `.select()`. This lets us grab an element by specifying its ID.

~~~{.js} Create the SVG container inside chart element.

var chart_area = d3.select("#chart_area");
var svg = chart_area.append("svg");
~~~

In the next step, we append the element by an SVG canvas. This is equivalent to writing 

~~~{.html}
<p id="chart"> <svg> </svg> </p>
~~~

in the html file. We chose to append because we now have access to the SVG element without the need to seperately select it by ID.




Let's set up the dimensions of the chart:

~~~{.js}
// Chart dimensions.
var margin = {top: 19.5, right: 19.5, bottom: 19.5, left: 39.5};
var width = 960 - margin.right;
var height = 500 - margin.top - margin.bottom;
~~~
