We've finally learned everything we need to know to start using D3. 
D3 is a Javascript library. This means that we can use all of the Javascript commands that we have already learned, but on top of these, there are a few new functions that will make our life easier.

The main purpose of D3 is to create visualisations of data online. Because it uses Javascript, it is possible to make graphs interactive! 

As a little refresher, we will repeat a little bit html to set up our page. 

Create `index.html` containing the following:

~~~{.html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>The Wealth & Health of the N-Nations</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>The Wealth & Health of the N-Nations</h1>

    <p id="chart"_area></p>

    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

There are a few things in this file that look new:
'<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />' is linking the local css file (that can just be an empty file for now). `<script src="main.js"></script>` is linking the Javascript file, the file in which all the action will happen. 

Additionally, we now need to link d3 using `<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>`. 

The last bit, that's important here is an html element (paragraph) we create. We give it an id `chart_area`. This is the area we reserve for our pretty chart. We will use Javascript (and D3) to fill it in. 


Now, let's write main.js.

Similar to the syntax we've already seen (`JSON.stringify`), D3-specific functions can be called using a `d3.`-syntax.

The first thing we need, is of course our data, which is stored in 'nations.json'.
D3 provides a handy function to read in `json`-files:

~~~{.d3}
d3.json("resources/nations.json", function(nations) { }
~~~

This line probably needs a little explanation and we'll go through it bit by bit: 

* `d3.json()` is called the function call. In this case, we have a function that reads in a json file, parses it, and is also able to do something with the parsed data on the way.
* The first argument `"resources/nations.json"` tells the function where to get the data we want to have parsed.
* `function(...){...}` is called the callback function. It is a so-called 'inline' function, which means it has no name (we're only operating in the object space here). This also means we can't use this function anywhere else in our code. The code we put inside the curly brackets is the code that's run once d3.json() is called and the data is loaded.
* D3 assigns the name `nations` to the parsed object it returns. We can only use 'nations' within the callback function, this means our code only knows of `nations` inside the curly brackets.
* What seems unusual, but is actually quite common, is that this function call doesn't return anything. It is simply executed and displayed (if we tell it to), but no value is returned. 


So naturally, the next step is to think about what we want to happen between the curly brackets.
For now, we want to:

* Link Javascript to html page
* Insert an SVG canvas
* Create axes (x: income per capita, y: life expectancy)
* Display data points (scatter plot)

First, let's draw a little schematic of how we want the page to be structured.

<img src="img/chart_area.png" alt="What we want.." width="700" />

We already set up our html page to contain a chart area. That's the space we want to 
fill now. 
We'll have a picture frame (an SVG-element), our drawing area (a g-element), and in 
that drawing area, we'll have separate elements for both axes and the area for our circles.

Firt, we need to link the Javascript and html environement so that we have writing access
to the html.
To do this, we use the `.select()`. This lets us grab an element by specifying its ID.

~~~{.js} 
// Select the chart area by ID 
var chart_area = d3.select("#chart_area");
~~~

Now we're setting up the grid by appending the chart area by the SVG picture frame.

~~~{.js} 
var frame = chart_area.append("svg");
~~~

This is equivalent to writing:

~~~{.html}
<p id="chart_area"> <svg> </svg> </p>
~~~

in the html file. We chose to append because we now have access to the SVG element without the need to seperately select it by ID.

We also create the canvas inside the frame:

~~~{.js}
// Create canvas inside frame.
var canvas = svg.append("g");
~~~

Let's set up the dimensions for our elements that we want to use:

~~~{.js}
// Set margins, width, and height.
var margin = {top: 19.5, right: 19.5, bottom: 19.5, left: 39.5};
var frame_width = 960;
var frame_height = 350;
var canvas_width = frame_width - margin.left - margin.right;
var canvas_height = frame_height - margin.top - margin.bottom;
~~~

...and apply them to the actual elements:

~~~{.js}
// Set frame attributes width and height.
frame.attr("width", frame_width);
frame.attr("height", frame_height);
~~~

The canvas element will have to fit nicely into the frame. To make it fit, we set
a transform attribute and use the translate function. 

~~~{.js}
// Shift the canvas and make it slightly smaller than the svg canvas.
canvas.attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");
~~~

This might need to be a new lesson(?): 

* Make scales and axes

~~~{.js}
// Various scales. These domains make assumptions of data, naturally.
var xScale = d3.scale.log(); // income
xScale.domain([300, 1e5]);
xScale.range([0, canvas_width]);  


// d3 has a subobject called scale. within scale, there are a number of functions to create scales.
// e.g. log, linear, sqrt, category10 (e.g. 10 different colours)... 
// we set the domain based on our data - min and max of the data
// we set the range - range on the page
// domain, range, log scale all determing data values are mapped to graph positions.

var yScale = d3.scale.linear().domain([10, 85]).range([canvas_height, 0]);  // life expectancy

// an alternative notation that d3 offers is to chain everything together using the dot-syntax 
// (you'll see this a lot). The order is mostly arbitrary. 

// Creating the x & y axes.
var xAxis = d3.svg.axis().orient("bottom").scale(xScale);
var yAxis = d3.svg.axis().scale(yScale).orient("left");



    // Next step: push the axes into the chart


  // Add the x-axis.
  canvas.append("g")
  .attr("class", "x axis")
    .attr("transform", "translate(0," + canvas_height + ")")
    .call(xAxis);

    // .call is the bit where the properties we just set are pushed to the object
    // attribures are added to make it look pretty (class is used in the css file)


  // Add the y-axis.
  canvas.append("g")
    .attr("class", "y axis")
    .call(yAxis);

~~~

* Put in some data

~~~{.js}

var data_2009 = nations.map( function(nation) {
  return {
    x : nation.income[nation.income.length-1][1],
    y : nation.lifeExpectancy[nation.lifeExpectancy.length-1][1]
  }
});


var dot = frame.append("g")
      .attr("class", "dots")
    .selectAll(".dot")
      .data(data_2009) // each of the points has the data_2009 element bound to it.
    .enter().append("circle")
      .attr("cx", function(d) { return xScale(d.x); }) // this is why attr knows to work with the data
      .attr("cy", function(d) { return yScale(d.y); })
      .attr("r", 5 );

New lesson:

* transitions: create time steps and switch between different countries (?)

New lesson:

* D3 page: how do I make the plot I want?
* What are alternatives to using D3?
