* adding a filter - we only want bubbles for big countries

> # Filtering by region {.challenge}
> You might have noticed that our data contains information about the region in 
> which a country is. 
> 1. Create a filter so that you only display data points from "Sub-Saharan Africa".

* Checkboxes (exit)
